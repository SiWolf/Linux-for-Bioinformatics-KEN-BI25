# Workshop Nanopore Bioinformatics

A practical introduction to Linux for bioinformatics within the framework of the project "A Partnership to Strengthen Integrated Genomic Surveillance through Greater Capacities in National Public Health Institutes (IGS Project). The project aims to strengthen genomic surveillance capacities while integrating these into the public health system. 

The overall learning objectives of this course are
* Navigate the Linux file system efficiently
* Maintain an efficient folder structure for research data
* Extract and reuse information from bioinformatics files
* Write small bash scripts for automatisation
* Install and run bioinformatics software from different sources
