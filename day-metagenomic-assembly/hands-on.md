# Workshop: Metagenome assembly, binning, qc, and annotation

Now we want to reconstruct genomes from the [ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard II, Log Distribution (CSII)](https://www.zymoresearch.de/products/zymobiomics-microbial-community-dna-standard-ii-log-distribution) sample, downsampled to 10% of the total number of reads, that we started working on yesterday. Continue using the length-filtered data set that you should have stored in a folder such as `reads/zymo-2022-barcode01-perc10.filtered.fastq`.
